# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Rails files/folders
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle
.DS_Store
.byebug_history
README.rdoc
/doc

# config/secrets.yml
# config/secrets.distrib.yml

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp
local.log

# Ignore Values Received Payment Pages
# app/views/cart/_ex3.html.erb
# app/views/cart/_fd1.html.erb
# app/views/cart/_fd2.html.erb
